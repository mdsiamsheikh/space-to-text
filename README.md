# Voice-to-text transcription app


This is a web app 
that converts spoken words into text using the OpenAI API. It's built with HTML, CSS, and the OpenAI API for voice-to-text transcription. Users can simply navigate to the page, allow microphone access, and start speaking. The text is converted in real-time and can be copied and pasted into any document or application. The app showcases the power of the OpenAI API and is a great starting point for exploring voice-to-text technology.
